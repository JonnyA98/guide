This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

In order to run the app locally you also need to create a free supabase account and adding the tables that are written out in the guide_schema.csv file.

You then need to connect your database by copying the .ev.example file into a .env.local file and getting the variables from the supabase website in your account

CURRENTLY ONLY TESTED EMAIL ADDRESS THAT WORKS TO LOG IN IS OUTLOOK.
